## Sorting Algorithms (In Python)

### ==Description==
This is file has five different ways to sort algoritims including Bubble sort, Selction sort, Insertion sort, Shell sort and Merge sort. View the time complexity of each algorithm below.


#### Bubble Sort:
Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>)


#### Selection Sort:
Slection Sort has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>)


#### Insertion Sort:
Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) with an average case of O(n<sup>2</sup>)


#### Shell Sort:
Shell Sort has an average time complexity of O(n<sup>4/3</sup>)


#### Merge Sort:
Merge Sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n)
