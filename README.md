## Sorting Algorithms (In Python)

### ==Description==</h3>
This is file has five different ways to sort algoritims including Bubble sort, Selction sort, Insertion sort, Shell sort and Merge sort. View the time complexity of each algorithm below.


#### Bubble Sort:
        Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2)


#### Selection Sort:
        Slection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2)


#### Insertion Sort:
        Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) with an average case of O(n^2)


#### Shell Sort:
        Shell Sort has an average time complexity of O(n^4/3)


#### Merge Sort:
        Merge Sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n)
